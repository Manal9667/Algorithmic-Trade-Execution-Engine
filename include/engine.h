/**
 * MatchingEngine class
 * 
 * Processes incoming orders and matches them against the order book.
 * 
 * Main entry point: submit_order(order)
 * Returns a vector of Trade objects created by the match.
 * 
 * Handles:
 * - Market orders (fill greedily at best available prices)
 * - Limit orders (fill up to price limit, post remainder)
 * - Partial fills (one order can match multiple price levels)
 * - FIFO semantics (first order in, first order out at each level)
 * 
 * Example usage:
 *   MatchingEngine engine;
 *   Order sell_order(1, OrderSide::Sell, OrderType::Limit, 100.0, 100);
 *   engine.submit_order(sell_order);
 *   
 *   Order buy_order(2, OrderSide::Buy, OrderType::Market, 0, 100);
 *   auto trades = engine.submit_order(buy_order);
 *   // trades[0] contains the matched trade
